# KNN-algorithm
This is a KNN algorithm I used on a dataset containing bank information.
I split the data into training and validation sets. 
I also iterated different values of K and inputed the data from a confusion matrix into a data frame to see which value of K yields the highest accuracy.
3 was the best choice for K according to the accuracy data frame.
